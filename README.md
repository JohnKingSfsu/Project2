# Words in Motion

by John King

## Project Overview

This is a website representing community using a quote that reminds me of community. The quote I chose is by an artist named Colde, in a song called "Nirvana Blues". In the song, he says, "Baby, I'm just tryna rock, Turn my life into my lyrics, Keep it in my heart-shaped box, Yeah, I know, Looking back on all the time I spent, Let it all replay inside my head, Good old days, remember? I could stay in this place forever". I chose this quote to use because the entire song is about connecting people together who like music. The quote I chose is a specific part of the song which I took to mean that he represents himself through his lyrics, and he plays the music he likes back in his head. I connected this to community because I believe all people who like music do the same, they listen to the lyric and replay music they like in their head. This website represents the community of music lovers by using a quote that they all relate to.
